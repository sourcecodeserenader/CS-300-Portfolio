# CS-300 Analysis and Design Portfolio

## Overview
This repository contains my CS-300 Analysis and Design Portfolio project for SNHU 
The project demonstrates data structures, algorithms, and program design principles

## Project Details
- Course: CS-300 Analysis and Design  
- Programming Language: C++  
- Project: Course Planner Program  
- Skills Demonstrated: File I/O, Data Structures, User Interaction  

## How to Run the Program
1. Download `ProjectTwo.cpp`.
2. Compile and run it in a C++ IDE (Visual Studio recommended)
3. Follow the on screen menu instructions

## Reflection
This project helped me gain a deeper understanding of file handling, data structures, and menu driven programs. It strengthened my C++ skills and reinforced best coding practices
